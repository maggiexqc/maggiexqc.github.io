            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p> 
                I am a recent graduate with a computer science major and biological science minor at UC Davis.
                I am passionate about software development, full-stack engineering, and iOS development. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have experience working with Python, JavaScript, C++, and Swift, and have worked internships and projects
                using AI and APIs, see my resume for more!
            </p>
            <h2>What I'm up to:</h2>
            <p>
                I recently moved to NYC and am working on my current projects, Astronote and Moody,
                while looking for full-time software engineering opportunities and exploring the city.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can often find me at cafes working on my projects, or at home baking/cooking trying new recipes.
            </p>
