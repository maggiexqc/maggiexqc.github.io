            <h2>Info:</h2>
            <p> Astronote is my current project, it is set to be the first atomic-style handwritten note-taking app across all iOS and macOS devices.
                This style of notes allows users to break down information into its core concepts and link them to information already learned in previous notes for better memory recall. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This app includes intuitive gestures and navigation which allows for an easier and faster note-taking experience.
