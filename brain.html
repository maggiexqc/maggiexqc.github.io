            <h2>Info:</h2>
            <p> 
                This AI web application was developed to identify 3 different types of tumors: Meningioma, Glioma, and Pituitary.
                The application uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies MRI brain scans. This CNN has been
                trained to accurately identify and classify tumor types with a 99.8% test accuracy by employing K-fold cross-validation techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was created as a part of a group project for ECS 170: Artificial Intelligence at UC Davis.
                I designed and deployed the application using Heroku; and implemented a robust 3d model interface with Three.js, 
                enabling seamless uploading and processing of .mat files while integrating HTTP methods for efficient backend 
                communication and data handling. 
            </p>

                Enter in a MRI brain scan of a .mat file type into our app and the CNN will determine whether there is a tumor
                present, as well as the type of tumor between Meningioma, Glioma, and Pituitary tumors.
