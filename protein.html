            <h2>Info:</h2>
            <p> 
                This app takes in high-throughput protein data for bioinformatic analysis for evaluation in the form 
                of visual plots of gene expression levels between COVID-19 patients with olfactory loss (loss of smell)
                and non infected individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a research project belonging to Gong Lab at UC Davis School of Medicine and has the potential 
                to identify quantitative and qualitative protein changes associated with COVID-19-induced 
                olfactory loss and to better understand viral infection induced responses in olfactory systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fun fact: I started off as the research assistant to extract the proteins from samples and
                ended up becoming the co-developer for this project.

            <h2>Presenting the research:</h2>
            <p>
                In April 2024 I presented this research at the UC Davis Undergraduate Research Conference!
